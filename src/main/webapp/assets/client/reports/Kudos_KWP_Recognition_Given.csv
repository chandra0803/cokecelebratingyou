You’re so freaking smart, funny, optimistic (even your shade has light :-)) and you love problems. You want to help people at Coke have an amazing,generative experience at work, and you know the only way to really produce thatis to live it yourself. It was a real treat to work on the Recognition 3.0 strategywith you last week. I wish all of my long meetings included such a perfect mixof intellectual stimulation, creativity, practicality, jokes, food and friends.I’m excited about the impact we can make and the fun we’ll have doing it. Thankyou for inviting me and for all of your partnership!#pancakesandbasketball #letsbedopeAF #wouldgiveyoupointsificould"
