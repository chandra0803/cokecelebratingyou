   * Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer
   * as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
   * <p>
   * <p/> The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x))</tt> for
   * all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>. (This implies that <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an
   * exception if and only if <tt>compare(y, x)</tt> throws an exception.)
   * <p>
   * <p/> The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
   * <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0)
   * &amp;&amp; (compare(y, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
   * <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.
   * <p>
   * <p/> Finally, the implementer must ensure that <tt>compare(x, y)==0</tt> implies that
   * <tt>sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z))</tt> for all <tt>z</tt>.
   * <p>
   * <p/> It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that <tt>(compare(x, y)==0) ==
   * (x.equals(y))</tt>.
   * Generally speaking, any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this
   * fact. The recommended language is "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that are
   * inconsistent with equals."

   * @param o2 the second object to be compared.
   * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than,

   *           Comparator.
